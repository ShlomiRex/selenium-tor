# About

This repo is basic example to show how to start Tor browser with Selenium.

Because of all the changes to Python, selenium, and bunch of changes to the Python libraries, this repo represents my successful research and deployment of basic Tor browser automation.

## How to run

- Step 1: Start Tor browser manually
- Step 2: Run the script

The selenium code will use the Tor proxy to connect to the Tor network.

The Tor proxy is running on port 9150 by default.
